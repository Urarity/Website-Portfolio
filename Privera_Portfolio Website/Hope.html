		<p id="none2">Now what I mentioned before was YouTube. I thought that the best website to take the 2nd Inspirational
		link is Humble Bundle. It is a non-profit organization that combines two things that I love, gaming and charity. 
		This website started in 2010 and since then raised over $50 million dollars for charity, and not just one charity, 
		many from American Red Cross to Action Against Hunger, this money gives children and adults alike have hope.
		Some YouTubers make advent calendars. These give you games every day for a month and all it asks Is for you to
		donate money to charity. Humble Bundle also adds in a counter for how you spend your money, you get the game 
		but you have the option to give all your money to charity, all of it to Humble bundle, 50/50, anything you want.
		This inspires me so when I make my game, I definitely want my game to be put on this website for a good cause like donating to charity helping people all over the world.
