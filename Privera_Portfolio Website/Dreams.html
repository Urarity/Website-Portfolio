		<p id="none">Whether you are just a viewer or a person who uploads videos, commonly known as a YouTuber.
		YouTube is used to upload content from entertainment, news, how to videos, motivational, etc. This platform has grown since it first
		started, to now, where people can get a full job based on it. This platform is inspirational to me and to people around the world.
		I don't personally want a full job on this but it was the platform that got me into what "gaming" is. I’m not hesitant to say that 
		YouTube is one of the platforms to make me realize what my dream is. I want to be a programmer, I wondered what made games, “games”
		so I searched it up and found out what programming is, since then that has and still is my dream. My dream right now is to get a job I know
		I will enjoy, but my ultimate goal is to make my own game and have YouTubers and people in general be interested to play my game, and if 
		I work hard enough, for them to enjoy it. That is what I find inspirational about YouTube. Millions of people who are inspired by this 
		huge community for their own dreams or if the videos they watch help them through their tough life and lift them up even a little is so awe inspiring.
